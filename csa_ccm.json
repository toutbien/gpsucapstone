In addition, agreements should include requirements to address the information security risks associated with information and communications technology services (e.g., cloud computing services) and the product supply chain. These requirements are subsequently applicable to relevant, third-party (i.e., fourth parties)  subcontractors (and so on) throughout the supply chain.\n\nPersonnel security requirements should be established and documented\u2014including security roles and responsibilities for third-party providers coordinated and aligned with internal security roles and responsibilities. Monitor providers for compliance.\n\nAdditionally, the organization should have a screening process for contractors and third-party users. When organizations provide contractors, the contract should specify the organization's responsibilities for screening and relevant notification procedures if screening has not been completed (or if the results cause doubts or concerns). Similarly, third-party agreements should specify all responsibilities and notification procedures for screening.\n\nThird-party providers should notify a designated individual or role (e.g., a member of the contracting or supply chain function) of any personnel transfers or terminations of third-party personnel who possess organizational credentials, badges, or have information system privileges.\n\nFormal contracts should be employed that, at a minimum, specify:\na. The covered information\u2019s confidential nature and value.\nb. The security measures to be implemented and/or complied with. These include the organization's information security requirements and appropriate controls required by applicable federal laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards and guidance, and third-party access limitations.\nc. The service levels to be achieved in the services provided.\nd. The format and frequency of reporting to the organization's information security management forum.\ne. The arrangement for representation of the third party in appropriate organizational meetings and working groups.\nf. The arrangements for third-party compliance auditing.\ng. The penalties exacted if any of the preceding specifications fail.\n\nMutually agreed-upon provisions and/or terms should be established to satisfy customer (tenant) requirements for service-to-service application (API), information processing interoperability, portability for application development and information exchange, usage, and integrity persistence.",
